          <p> Collecting and using rainwater can be a great way to conserve resources. It is important that the rainwater system is maintained properly and the water quality is appropriate for the intended use.<!--A Big THANK YOU to our farmers. We are always amazed what you are able to accomplish. Our hungry world is well cared for by you.  Thank you and may God bless you with good health to continue your wonderful caring work.--></p>

      <h2>About Rainfall Prediction Application</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: left;">Rainfall Prediction is a web app which has 
      a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to predict what will be the rainfall in perticuler month and year. This model is based on the Rain Predictionin India dataset. 
	  <br><br>
      After training and testing, the monthly rainfall forecasts are compared to actual data to validate the model's 
      accuracy. The findings of this study show that the model can accurately forecast monthly rainfall data when certain 
      parameters are used. Rainfall prediction is one of the most frequently studied fields, as it affects many people's lives and 
      property. Previous rainfall prediction models made extensive use of a complex mix of mathematical instruments, which were 
      insufficient to achieve a better categorization rate. Using Machine Learning Algorithms analysis, we suggest new approaches for estimating monthly rainfall in this research. Predictions of rainfall are created using quantitative data about the present state of the atmosphere. Several machine learning techniques can learn complicated input-to-output mappings. Because of the dynamic nature of the atmosphere, accurate rainfall prediction is challenging. The fluctuation in prior year's circumstances must be used to anticipate future rainfall conditions. Using numerous characteristics such as temperature, humidity, and wind, we advocated the usage of machine Learning Algorithms. The proposed model tends to forecast rainfall based on the previous records of a particular geographic area; therefore, this prediction will prove to be much reliable. The performance of the model is more accurate when compared with traditional rainfall prediction systems.
